## Building the plugin:

First, compile the theme template files via python. Run the following python command from the project root:

```
python ./theme.py
```

This will generate the theme `*.json` and scheme `*.xml` files in `src/main/resources`. 

To build the plugin for distribution, run the following gradle wrapper script from the project root:

```
./gradlew assemble
```

This will produce an installable plugin distribution located at `build/distributions/jetbrains-trash-panda-theme-[version].zip`.
