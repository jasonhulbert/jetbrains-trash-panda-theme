# Vim Trash Panda Theme

A theme for raccoons and other creatures of the night.

This is a work-in-progress port of the trashpanda theme to vim

[Installing] 

1. Download the trashpanda.vim file
2. Place the trashpanda.vim file into your ~/.vim/colors folder
3. Run the command ':colorscheme trashpanda'


[Setting a default colorscheme]
To set trashpanda as your default colorscheme simply add
    colorscheme trashpanda
to your ~/.vimrc file.

Trashpanda.vim will now be loaded as your default colorscheme


[Troubleshooting]
If vim won't load or display the theme correctly
First run the command
    :colorscheme
in vim and make sure it returns
    trashpanda
If it does, run
    :set termguicolors
this enables full color support
